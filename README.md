#Mini-carousel.js
Mini-carousel.js is a mini jQuery library that extends carousel functions based on bootstrap and swiper.

### What's included
Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:

```
dist/
├── css/
│   ├── mini-carousel.css
│   ├── mini-carousel.css.map
│   └── mini-carousel.min.css
└── js/
    ├── mini-carousel.js
    └── mini-carousel.min.js

```

## Custom Builds
Mini-carousel.js is powered by [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), and you can create custom builds pretty easily. First of all, you’ll need Grunt and all other dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install && bower install && grunt
```
